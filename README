READ AND WRITE CPCAP PMIC REGISTERS ON ANDROID DEVICES

This utility allows easily reading and writing the CPCAP PMIC registers
when booted to the Android kernel. The Motorola custom CPCAP PMIC is used
on various Motorola phones and tablets such as droid 4.

Note that it currently only supports the mainline kernel regmap suitable
registers offsets as listed in motorola-cpcap.h and not the Motorola
mapphone Linux kernel register index.

To build and use, just do:

$ export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/arm-linux-gnueabi
$ make
$ adb push cpcaprw /sdcard
$ adb shell
$ su
# mount -o rw,remount /system/bin
# cp/sdcard/cpcaprw /system/bin/
# cpcaprw 0x0048 # read CPCAP_REG_VERSC1
CPCAP register18 0x0048=0x0013

For write access, you probably need to modify the selinux permissions
for /dev/cpcap with chcon or something similar.

And note that to use the binary with most Android kernels, the compiler
must be armel and not armhf.
